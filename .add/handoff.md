# Session Handoff
**Written:** 2026-02-17 17:20

## In Progress
- Milestone files (task #10) — not started yet, create `docs/milestones/` from PRD
- Cross-project learning library search (task #11) — not started, needs spec first (spec-before-code!)
- Both are the next cycle's work items

## Completed This Session
- Implemented all 12 remaining ACs for session-continuity spec (34/34 complete)
- First retro completed and archived to `.add/retros/retro-2026-02-17.md`
- Marked all 5 specs Complete
- Bumped version to 0.3.0 (30 files)
- Created GitHub release v0.3.0 with release notes
- Synced marketplace cache
- Promoted "spec-before-code discipline" to Tier 1 knowledge

## Decisions Made
- dossierFYI dogfooding feedback drove v0.2→v0.3 (noted in release notes)
- Spec-before-code is non-negotiable going forward (retro agreed change)
- No blog post for v0.3.0 — focus on milestones + library search instead
- Anthropic plugin submission doesn't need resubmit (they review repo at HEAD)

## Blockers
- None

## Next Steps
1. Create milestone files from PRD (`docs/milestones/M1-core-plugin.md`, etc.)
2. Write spec for cross-project learning library search (spec first!)
3. Implement learning library search
4. These are the two remaining items from the agreed next cycle
