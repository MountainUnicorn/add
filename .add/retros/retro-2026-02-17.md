# Retrospective — ADD
**Period:** 2026-02-07 → 2026-02-17
**Mode:** Interactive (first retro)

## Period Summary

- Specs completed: 5 of 5 (all marked Complete this retro)
- Commits: 56 on main
- Away-mode sessions: 2
- Agent checkpoints: 7

## Human Perspective

**Q1: What went well?**
Good acceptance of critical feedback while maintaining an independent view — accepting some but not all comments. As an open-source project, there will be lots of negative feedback. Our job is to pull out the gems.

**Q2: What was frustrating?**
Nothing at this point.

**Q3: Agent collaboration feedback?**
No issues.

## Agent Observations

- High velocity: 56 commits in 10 days, v0.1.0 built in single session
- Parallel subagents consistently effective (5-agent cycles completing in ~90s)
- 4 specs had implementations but were still marked Draft — spec-after-code violation
- No observations.md file yet — expected gap addressed by v0.3.0 implementation
- 5 profile update candidates pending since 2026-02-07 — all already in profile.md
- Learnings.md at 129 lines — some entries promoted to Tier 1 but not pruned

## Agreed Changes

1. **Spec-before-code discipline** — 4 Draft specs marked Complete (implementations exist). Going forward, no feature work starts without a spec first. We dog-food our own methodology.
2. **Profile candidates resolved** — All 5 pending items confirmed already in profile.md. Section cleared.
3. **Observations pipeline** — Known v0.3.0 gap, now addressed by session-continuity spec implementation. No further action.

## Actions Taken

- Marked 4 specs Complete: branding-system, image-gen-detection, auto-changelog, infographic-generation
- Cleared Profile Update Candidates section in learnings.md (all 5 already in profile)
- Created retro archive at .add/retros/retro-2026-02-17.md
- Assessed plugin-global promotion candidates (see below)

## Plugin-Global Promotion Assessment

Assessed Tier 3 learnings for Tier 1 (knowledge/global.md) promotion:
- "Spec-before-code discipline must be dog-fooded" — universal ADD methodology truth. **Promoted.**
- Version bump checklist — ADD-project-specific, not universal. Not promoted.
- enabledPlugins format — Claude Code-specific technical detail, already implicitly covered. Not promoted.
