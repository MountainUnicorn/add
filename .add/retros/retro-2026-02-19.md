# Retrospective — ADD
**Period:** 2026-02-17 → 2026-02-19
**Context:** Collaborative (active interactive exchanges, 1 short away session)
**Mode:** Interactive (context-aware flow — first use of retro template automation)

## Period Summary

- Specs completed: 3 (learning-library-search, legacy-adoption, retro-template-automation)
- Commits: 21 on main
- Agent learnings recorded: 28 (26 project, 2 workstation) — 6 backfilled during retro
- Human directives captured: 4
- Away-mode sessions: 2

## Human Directives

| # | Directive | Scope | Source |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Handoffs must auto-write — never ask permission | workstation | session feedback |
| 2 | Commit, push, sync is standard post-change sequence | workstation | repeated pattern |
| 3 | Hold off on tutorial docs/video until v0.6.0 | project | session directive |
| 4 | v0.5.0 will focus on project management | project | session directive |

**Confirmation:** All confirmed as correct.

## Agent Observations (Project)

No new entries since last retro (gap identified — see methodology adherence). 6 checkpoint entries backfilled during retro (L-029 through L-034).

### ADD Methodology Adherence

| Rule | Status | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| Spec-before-code | ✓ Pass | All 3 features specced before implementation |
| Plans before implementation | ✓ Pass | Plans created for all 3 features |
| Auto-handoffs | ✓ Pass | Written after commits and major work |
| Source control | ✓ Pass | Conventional commits on all 21 commits |
| Learning checkpoints | ✗ Fail | 0 of ~6 expected entries written. Backfilled during retro. |
| Quality gates | ✗ Fail | /add:verify never run this period |

## Agent Observations (Workstation)

(Skipped — no new entries since last retro)

## Refinement

Checkpoint gap identified and fixed during retro — 6 entries backfilled (L-029 through L-034).

## What Went Well

Spec-before-code discipline held across all 3 features.

## What Needs Improvement

Already captured in learnings (checkpoint gap).

## Scores

| Metric | Score | Evidence |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Human Collaboration | 4.0 / 9.0 | User-provided score |
| ADD Methodology Effectiveness | 5.8 / 9.0 | Core discipline strong (spec/plan/commit 100%), observability weak (checkpoints missed, verify not run) |
| Swarm Effectiveness | 6.2 / 9.0 | Parallel subagents effective, away sessions efficient (10min/45min), context loss on session compaction |

## ADD Methodology Feedback

1. Methodology adherence section was hard to read — needs table layout instead of inline checkmarks
2. Empty tables (Table 3) should not be shown at all — skip silently
3. Fixing data gaps during retro should be a background task — don't block the human while writing checkpoint entries

## Agreed Changes

1. **Methodology adherence: table format** — replace inline ✓/✗ text with a proper markdown table
2. **Skip empty tables** — enforce AC-029 strictly, never show a blank table
3. **Background fixes** — checkpoint backfills and data repairs run silently, retro flow continues without waiting

## Actions Taken

- Backfilled 6 checkpoint entries (L-029 through L-034)
- Updated retro command with 3 improvements from feedback
- Retro archive written
- Scores recorded to retro-scores.json
- ADD feedback recorded to add-feedback.md
