> This file lives at `~/.claude/add/library.md` and accumulates wisdom across ALL your projects.
> Entries are promoted from individual project `.add/learnings.md` files during retrospectives.
>
> This is one of three knowledge tiers agents read before starting work:
> 1. **Tier 1: Plugin-Global** (`knowledge/global.md`) — universal ADD best practices
> 2. **Tier 2: User-Local** (this file) — your cross-project wisdom
> 3. **Tier 3: Project-Specific** (`.add/learnings.md`) — per-project discoveries
