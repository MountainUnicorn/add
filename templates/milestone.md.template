# Milestone: M{N} — {MILESTONE_NAME}

**Target Maturity:** {MATURITY_LEVEL}
**Status:** {NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETE}
**Started:** {DATE_OR_TBD}
**Completed:** {DATE_OR_TBD}

## Goal

{MILESTONE_GOAL — 1-2 sentences describing what success looks like}

Example: "Stabilize the authentication system and reduce session timeout bugs by 90%, enabling alpha users to trust login across mobile and web clients."

## Success Criteria

- [ ] {CRITERION_1}
- [ ] {CRITERION_2}
- [ ] {CRITERION_3}
- [ ] {CRITERION_4}
- [ ] {CRITERION_5}

Example criteria:
- [ ] All authentication specs passing in staging
- [ ] Zero authentication-related bugs in production for 7 days
- [ ] Mobile and web session parity (same timeout behavior)
- [ ] Automated session refresh working end-to-end
- [ ] Acceptance test coverage ≥ 95% for auth features

## Appetite

{How much effort we're willing to spend. Not an estimate — a budget.}

Examples:
- "2 weeks of focused work"
- "1 sprint cycle (5 days)"
- "3 cycles of parallel exploration"
- "Exploratory — stop when we have proof of concept"
- "Fixed scope: ~40 hours" (if time-boxed)

## Features

### Hill Chart

Progress visualization. Format: `{FEATURE_NAME} {PROGRESS_BAR} {uphill|peak|downhill} — {status detail}`

```
Authentication Overhaul       ████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  downhill — testing & edge cases
Session Refresh Automation    ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  peak — figured out approach, starting implementation
Mobile Logout Flow            ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  uphill — design in progress, dependencies unclear
```

**Reading the chart:**
- `████` = progress to date (uphill = figuring it out, downhill = executing)
- `░░` = remaining work
- **Uphill** = uncertainty phase (SHAPED → SPECCED, figuring out scope/approach)
- **Peak** = inflection point (PLANNED, have a plan, about to start)
- **Downhill** = execution phase (IN_PROGRESS → DONE, making it real)

### Feature Detail

| Feature | Spec | Position | Status | Cycle |
|---------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| {FEATURE_1} | specs/{feature_1}.md | SHAPED \| SPECCED \| PLANNED \| IN_PROGRESS \| VERIFIED \| DONE | {brief status detail} | cycle-{N} |
| {FEATURE_2} | specs/{feature_2}.md | SHAPED \| SPECCED \| PLANNED \| IN_PROGRESS \| VERIFIED \| DONE | {brief status detail} | cycle-{N} |
| {FEATURE_3} | specs/{feature_3}.md | SHAPED \| SPECCED \| PLANNED \| IN_PROGRESS \| VERIFIED \| DONE | {brief status detail} | cycle-{N} |

Example:
| Feature | Spec | Position | Status | Cycle |
|---------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Auth Overhaul | specs/auth-redesign.md | IN_PROGRESS | 3 of 5 acceptance criteria verified | cycle-8 |
| Session Refresh | specs/session-refresh.md | PLANNED | Ready to start, spec approved | cycle-8 |
| Mobile Logout | specs/mobile-logout.md | SPECCED | Spec written, dependencies clarified | cycle-9 |

## Dependencies

List any external blockers or prerequisites. Include:
- Features from **other milestones** that must complete first
- **Infrastructure changes** needed (e.g., new environment variables, database migrations)
- **Third-party integrations** pending (vendor API access, payment processor approval)
- **Team/resource** constraints (waiting for designer availability, etc.)

Example:
- Requires M3 (Infrastructure Refactor) to complete → provides new secrets manager API
- Payment provider API access pending approval (ETA: 2026-02-14)
- Design system update needed before UI feature specs can finalize

If no dependencies, write: "None — this milestone is self-contained."

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| {RISK_1} | HIGH \| MED \| LOW | HIGH \| MED \| LOW | {MITIGATION} |
| {RISK_2} | HIGH \| MED \| LOW | HIGH \| MED \| LOW | {MITIGATION} |
| {RISK_3} | HIGH \| MED \| LOW | HIGH \| MED \| LOW | {MITIGATION} |

Example:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Mobile session tokens expire faster than web, causing logout loop | MED | HIGH | Implement unified session TTL in auth redesign; add tests for parity |
| Session refresh causes race conditions under high concurrency | MED | MED | Load test with 1000 concurrent sessions before GA; spike on mutex strategy |
| Rollback needed after deployment | LOW | HIGH | Feature flag session refresh behind config; can disable in production in <5 min |

## Cycles

Track which cycles advance this milestone. Fill in as cycles complete.

| Cycle | Features Advanced | Status | Outcome |
|-------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| cycle-{N} | {Feature 1, Feature 2} | PLANNED \| IN_PROGRESS \| COMPLETE | {summary} |

Example:
| Cycle | Features Advanced | Status | Outcome |
|-------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| cycle-7 | Auth Overhaul (SHAPED→SPECCED) | COMPLETE | Spec written, 2 edge cases added, 1 design decision deferred to cycle-8 |
| cycle-8 | Auth Overhaul (SPECCED→IN_PROGRESS), Session Refresh (SHAPED→SPECCED) | IN_PROGRESS | Both on track; minor blocker on mobile device farm setup resolved |
| cycle-9 | Session Refresh (PLANNED→VERIFIED), Mobile Logout (SHAPED→SPECCED) | PLANNED | Ready to start Monday |

## Retrospective Notes

**Filled in when milestone completes.** Capture:
- What went well? (process, collaboration, discovery)
- What was harder than expected? (scope creep, technical debt, coordination)
- What learnings should inform the next milestone?
- Any process changes to adopt going forward?
- Maturity level readiness: Should we consider promoting?

Example retrospective:
```
### What Went Well
- Parallel auth + session refresh cycles saved 2 days
- TDD on auth was worth it — caught 3 race conditions in tests before QA found them
- Mobile testing device farm was game-changer for parity verification

### What Was Harder
- Session token rotation took 2 extra days (more state management than expected)
- Dependency on secrets manager delayed mobile testing (ETA slip: 1.5 days)

### Learnings
- Auth changes benefit from 2 reviewers (missed a logout edge case initially)
- Mobile parity testing should be in acceptance criteria from start, not bolted on
- Feature flags for rollback are essential — used twice during verification

### Process Changes
- For future auth milestones, require design review before specs (saves rework)
- Add mobile device farm setup as standard pre-cycle 1 task for mobile features

### Maturity Readiness
- We're ready to move from Alpha → Beta
- All Beta compliance items met: full specs, TDD on all features, pre-deploy QA complete
- Promotion: Create M10 (Maturity → Beta) to formalize practices
```

## Notes for Milestone Owners

**Appetite is NOT an estimate.** It's a time budget we're willing to spend. If halfway through the appetite and the hill chart is still mostly uphill, we have choices:
1. Extend appetite (burn more time)
2. Scope down features (accept less for this milestone)
3. Spike a specific unknown (time-box learning)

**Hill chart is the heartbeat.** Track it weekly (Beta/GA) or per-cycle (POC/Alpha). Uphill lingering too long? Flag blockers. Downhill stalling? Debug execution.

**Dependencies should be identified early.** If another team owns a blocker, escalate in first cycle, not last.

**Risks + Mitigations are live documents.** Update as cycle progress reveals new risks or mitigates existing ones.

**Retrospective is how we improve.** Don't skip it. Even 10-minute retros capture learnings for the next milestone.
