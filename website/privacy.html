      <!-- ===== OVERVIEW ===== -->
      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Snarky &amp; Quip LLC (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) handles information when you visit <strong>getadd.dev</strong> (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). We are committed to transparency about our data practices.</p>

      <p>The short version: we collect very little. This Site is a static informational website. We do not use analytics services, tracking pixels, advertising networks, or data brokers. We do not collect personal information through forms, account registration, or user-submitted content. The data processing that does occur is limited to what is described below.</p>

      <!-- ===== DATA CONTROLLER ===== -->
      <h2 id="data-controller">Data Controller</h2>

      <p>The data controller for information processed through this Site is:</p>

      <p><strong>Snarky &amp; Quip LLC</strong><br>
      Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@getadd.dev">privacy@getadd.dev</a></p>

      <p>If you have questions about how your data is handled, you can reach us at the email address above.</p>

      <!-- ===== WHAT WE COLLECT ===== -->
      <h2 id="what-we-collect">What We Collect</h2>

      <p>We do not directly collect personal information from visitors. We do not operate forms, user accounts, comment systems, newsletters, or any other mechanism that asks you to submit personal data.</p>

      <p>However, certain data is processed automatically when you visit the Site, as described in the sections below.</p>

      <!-- ===== HOSTING ===== -->
      <h2 id="hosting">Hosting &amp; Server Logs</h2>

      <p>This Site is hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, a static site hosting service provided by GitHub, Inc. (a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation).</p>

      <p>When you visit any page on this Site, GitHub&rsquo;s servers automatically process certain connection data to serve the requested page. This may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your IP address</li>
        <li>The date and time of your request</li>
        <li>The page(s) you requested</li>
        <li>Your browser type and version (user agent string)</li>
        <li>The referring URL (if any)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This processing is performed by GitHub as part of its hosting infrastructure. We do not have direct access to GitHub Pages server logs. GitHub processes this data in accordance with the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

      <p>Our lawful basis for this processing under the GDPR is <strong>legitimate interest</strong> (Article 6(1)(f)) &mdash; specifically, the necessity of serving web pages to visitors who request them.</p>

      <!-- ===== LOCAL STORAGE ===== -->
      <h2 id="local-storage">Local Storage</h2>

      <p>This Site uses your browser&rsquo;s <code>localStorage</code> to remember your theme preference (light mode or dark mode). Specifically, we store a single key:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>add-theme</code> &mdash; stores the value <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code></li>
      </ul>

      <p>This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to any server. It persists until you clear your browser data or manually change the setting. You can delete it at any time through your browser&rsquo;s developer tools or storage settings.</p>

      <p>We consider this storage <strong>strictly necessary</strong> for a functionality you explicitly request (toggling the theme), which is exempt from consent requirements under the ePrivacy Directive (Article 5(3)). No personal data is involved in this storage.</p>

      <!-- ===== COOKIES ===== -->
      <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

      <p>This Site does not set any cookies. We do not use first-party cookies, third-party cookies, or any cookie-based tracking mechanism.</p>

      <p>Note that GitHub Pages may set its own technical cookies as part of its hosting infrastructure. Any such cookies are governed by GitHub&rsquo;s own privacy policy, not ours.</p>

      <!-- ===== THIRD PARTY ===== -->
      <h2 id="third-party">Third-Party Services</h2>

      <p>This Site does not embed or load resources from third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. Specifically, we do not use:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Google Analytics or any analytics platform</li>
        <li>Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag, or any advertising pixel</li>
        <li>Hotjar, FullStory, or any session recording tool</li>
        <li>Any social media widgets, embedded content, or share buttons that load external resources</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The only external service involved in serving this Site is GitHub Pages, as described in the <a href="#hosting">Hosting &amp; Server Logs</a> section above.</p>

      <p>Links on this Site may direct you to external websites (such as <a href="https://github.com/MountainUnicorn/add" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our GitHub repository</a>). These external sites have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their data practices.</p>

      <!-- ===== INTERNATIONAL ===== -->
      <h2 id="international">International Transfers</h2>

      <p>GitHub Pages infrastructure is located in the United States. If you are visiting from outside the United States, your connection data (as described in the <a href="#hosting">Hosting &amp; Server Logs</a> section) will be processed in the United States by GitHub&rsquo;s servers.</p>

      <p>GitHub maintains data transfer mechanisms for international transfers in accordance with applicable law, including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers from the EU/EEA. Details are available in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

      <!-- ===== YOUR RIGHTS ===== -->
      <h2 id="your-rights">Your Rights</h2>

      <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data:</p>

      <h3>If you are in the EU/EEA or UK (under GDPR / UK GDPR)</h3>

      <p>You have the right to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> &mdash; request a copy of any personal data we hold about you</li>
        <li><strong>Rectification</strong> &mdash; request correction of inaccurate data</li>
        <li><strong>Erasure</strong> &mdash; request deletion of your personal data</li>
        <li><strong>Restriction</strong> &mdash; request restriction of processing</li>
        <li><strong>Objection</strong> &mdash; object to processing based on legitimate interest</li>
        <li><strong>Data portability</strong> &mdash; request your data in a structured, machine-readable format</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Because we do not directly collect or store personal data about visitors, we may not have data to provide, correct, or delete in response to a request. If you believe GitHub has logged data about your visit that you want addressed, you may also contact GitHub directly under their privacy policy.</p>

      <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. A list of EU/EEA supervisory authorities is available at <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edpb.europa.eu</a>.</p>

      <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getadd.dev">privacy@getadd.dev</a>. We will respond within 30 days.</p>

      <h3>If you are in Brazil (under LGPD)</h3>

      <p>You have similar rights to access, correct, delete, and port your data. Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getadd.dev">privacy@getadd.dev</a> to exercise these rights.</p>

      <!-- ===== CCPA ===== -->
      <h2 id="ccpa">California Residents</h2>

      <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) may provide you with additional rights regarding your personal information.</p>

      <p><strong>Categories of personal information collected:</strong> As described in the <a href="#hosting">Hosting &amp; Server Logs</a> section, the only personal information processed in connection with your visit is internet activity information (IP address, browser type, pages visited) automatically logged by our hosting provider.</p>

      <p><strong>Sale or sharing of personal information:</strong> We do not sell or share personal information as those terms are defined under the CCPA/CPRA. We have not sold or shared personal information in the preceding 12 months.</p>

      <p><strong>Your rights:</strong> California residents have the right to request disclosure of the categories and specific pieces of personal information collected, request deletion of personal information, and opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information (which we do not engage in). You also have the right to non-discrimination for exercising these rights.</p>

      <p>To submit a request, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getadd.dev">privacy@getadd.dev</a>. We will verify your identity and respond within 45 days.</p>

      <!-- ===== CHILDREN ===== -->
      <h2 id="children">Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>

      <p>This Site is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getadd.dev">privacy@getadd.dev</a> and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

      <!-- ===== CHANGES ===== -->

      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date at the top of this page. Because this Site does not collect email addresses or user accounts, we cannot notify you directly of changes. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

      <p>Material changes to this policy will also be noted in the Site footer or via our <a href="https://github.com/MountainUnicorn/add" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
