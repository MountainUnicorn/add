The MIT License governs your use, modification, and distribution of the plugin code.</p>

      <p>These Terms of Use apply to the <strong>website</strong> (getadd.dev) and its content. They are supplementary to, and do not replace, the MIT License that governs the plugin code itself.</p>

      <!-- ===== METHODOLOGY ===== -->
      <h2 id="methodology">Methodology Disclaimer</h2>

      <p>ADD is a development methodology &mdash; a set of principles, practices, and workflows for organizing AI-assisted software development. It is provided as educational and informational content.</p>

      <p>We make no guarantees that adopting ADD will produce any particular outcome for your project, team, or organization. Software development outcomes depend on many factors beyond methodology, including team skill, project complexity, tooling, requirements clarity, and operational context.</p>

      <p>The guidance provided on this Site (including best practices, enterprise recommendations, and workflow descriptions) reflects our current thinking and is subject to change. It should be evaluated in the context of your specific situation and requirements.</p>

      <!-- ===== AI-GENERATED CODE ===== -->
      <h2 id="ai-generated-code">AI-Generated Code Disclaimer</h2>

      <p>ADD is a methodology that orchestrates AI agents to write, test, review, and deploy software code. While ADD includes verification mechanisms (independent verification, quality gates, TDD cycles), <strong>AI-generated code may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, or other defects.</strong></p>

      <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reviewing all AI-generated code before deploying it to any environment</li>
        <li>Testing AI-generated code for correctness, security, and fitness for your intended purpose</li>
        <li>Ensuring AI-generated code complies with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards</li>
        <li>Any consequences arising from the use of AI-generated code in your systems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Neither Snarky &amp; Quip LLC nor the ADD project is responsible for the output of AI agents operating under the ADD methodology. ADD provides structure and verification workflows, but does not guarantee the correctness, safety, or suitability of any code produced.</p>
